- 🔭 I’m currently working with Angular and NX mono-repos, also Nest.js for BFFs running with Mongo, GraphQL, KeyCloak and AWS. 
- [Formoose](https://github.com/romulobordezani/formoose) is still in progress in my spare time, but I'm quite busy these days.
- 🌱 Also working on side projects and learning about:
  * `(Unity, 3D, C#) => Indie Game coming soon?`
  * `(JamStack, Headless CMSs, AWS Serverless & Cognito) => New Blog on the way?`
  * `(painting techiniques, color mastering, drawing and doodle arts) => Artist stuff on Instagram - Check it out!`
- 💡 I’m looking to improve my Vue.js skills some how, but only getting React and Angular projects to join now a days ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
